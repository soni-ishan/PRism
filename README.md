# PRism - Deployment Risk Intelligence

### Agentic Pre-Deployment Risk Gate, Powered by Microsoft AI Platform

> *Every engineer has shipped a breaking change. Tests passed. Linter was clean. And then production went down.*
>
> *PRism exists because "tests pass" ≠ "safe to ship."*

## The Problem

Current CI/CD pipelines are **binary and stateless**. They ask one question: *"Did the tests pass?"*

They never ask:
- Has this file caused production incidents before?
- Did test coverage actually drop for these new code paths?
- Are we deploying at 4:58 PM on a Friday before a long weekend?
- Was retry logic silently removed from a payment-critical path?

This makes deployment decisions feel like guesswork — and sometimes, they are. The result is incidents that were entirely preventable, post-mortems written at 2 AM, and engineers afraid to merge.

**PRism changes that.** Instead of a binary pass/fail gate, PRism gives every PR a **Deployment Confidence Score (0–100)** — a multi-agent risk assessment that considers code quality, historical incidents, test coverage, and operational timing, all in real time.

---

## How It Works

PRism triggers automatically when a PR is opened or updated. Four specialized AI agents analyze the change **in parallel**, each returning a structured JSON payload via a shared Data Contract. The Verdict Agent ingests all four payloads and converges on a single governed decision.

## The Agents

| Agent | Signal | Hero Tech |
|---|---|---|
| **Diff Analyst** | Scans PR diff for dangerous patterns — removed retry logic, missing error handlers, schema changes, hardcoded secrets | GitHub MCP Server + Azure OpenAI |
| **History Agent** | Correlates changed files with past production incidents via semantic search — *"payment_service.py involved in 4 of last 8 incidents"* | Azure MCP Server + Azure AI Search |
| **Coverage Agent** | Detects test coverage regression; triggers GitHub Copilot Coding Agent to auto-write missing tests and open a new PR | GitHub Copilot Coding Agent |
| **Timing Agent** | Flags high-risk deployment windows — Friday deploys, after-hours merges, pre-release proximity, US federal holidays | Microsoft Agent Framework |
| **Verdict Agent** | Ingests all four JSON payloads, computes Deployment Confidence Score (0–100), generates risk brief and rollback playbook via GPT-4o-mini with Azure Content Safety guardrails | Microsoft Foundry |

**Agent Weights:** Diff Analyst 30% · History Agent 25% · Coverage Agent 25% · Timing Agent 20%

---

## The Data Contract

Every specialist agent returns a **standardized JSON payload**. This enables true parallel execution — the Orchestrator dispatches all four agents simultaneously and the Verdict Agent aggregates without sequential handoffs.

```json
{
  "agent_name": "string",
  "risk_score_modifier": 25,
  "status": "warning",
  "findings": [
    "Specific finding 1",
    "Specific finding 2"
  ],
  "recommended_action": "Plain-English recommendation for the Verdict Agent."
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `agent_name` | string | Identifier for the agent |
| `risk_score_modifier` | integer 0–100 | 0 = perfectly safe, 100 = critical failure |
| `status` | enum | `"pass"` · `"warning"` · `"critical"` |
| `findings` | string[] | Specific, actionable findings |
| `recommended_action` | string | Plain-English recommendation for aggregation |

## Sample Output

A PR comment posted automatically by PRism:

```
🔬 PRism Deployment Risk Assessment

Confidence Score: 21 / 100  ⛔ HIGH RISK — Deploy Blocked

Risk Brief:
  • payment_service.py linked to 4 of the last 8 production incidents
  • Test coverage dropped 9% (3 new functions have no tests)
  • Deployment window: Friday 4:47 PM — historically high incident rate
  • retry logic removed from a payment-critical path

Action Taken:
  ✅ Missing tests auto-generated by Copilot → PR #47 opened for review
  📋 Rollback playbook generated → attached to this PR comment

To override, a maintainer with write access must manually approve.
```

## Setup

### Option 1 — Setup Wizard (Recommended)

The PRism Setup Platform provides a guided 3-step onboarding wizard — no YAML editing or shell scripts required:

```bash
cd platform
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in GITHUB_CLIENT_ID, GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET, AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET
uvicorn server.app:app --port 8080 --reload
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** in your browser. The wizard walks you through:
1. GitHub OAuth login + automatic `prism-gate.yml` workflow installation into your repo
2. Azure AD login + Log Analytics workspace selection (links your production incident history)
3. End-to-end connection verification

See [`platform/README.md`](platform/README.md) for full configuration details.

---

### Option 2 — Manual / Self-Hosted

> Prerequisites: Azure subscription with OpenAI + AI Search + Content Safety, GitHub account, Python 3.12+

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/soni-ishan/PRism.git
cd PRism

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in all Azure + GitHub credentials (see .env.example for full reference)

# Initialize Azure AI Search with sample incident data
python -m mcp_servers.azure_mcp_server.setup

# Run the orchestrator
uvicorn agents.orchestrator.server:app --reload --port 8000
```

Full Azure deployment via Bicep IaC: see [`foundry/deployment_config/README.md`](foundry/deployment_config/README.md)

---

### Option 3 — VS Code Extension

Download the **PRism** extension from the VS Code Marketplace (publisher: `thegooddatalab`). It connects to the hosted PRism backend automatically. As a special offer for the AI Dev Days Hackathon, up to **500 analysis runs** are provided free of charge for judges and reviewers using their own workspace.

See [`vscode_extension/README.md`](vscode_extension/README.md) for details.

## Hackathon

**AI Dev Days Hackathon — Microsoft, February 10 – March 15, 2026**

**Challenge:** *Automate and Optimize Software Delivery — Agentic DevOps*

**Target prizes:** Grand Prize (Agentic DevOps) · Best Multi-Agent System · Best Enterprise Solution · Best Azure Integration

**🎬 [Watch our 2-minute Demo Video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jAxC7I3zYk)**

PRism directly addresses the challenge criteria: intelligent CI/CD pipelines with agent orchestration, automated incident response, and real-time reliability monitoring — with a pre-deployment risk gate that tests against real-world production state, not just isolated code.

**For Judges:** Download our VS Code extension and experience PRism from your own workspace. We cover up to **500 analysis runs** using PRism's own Azure OpenAI model deployed on Microsoft Foundry — no Azure subscription required on your end.
